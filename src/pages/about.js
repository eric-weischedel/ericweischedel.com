          <p className="paragraph">
            In 1998, I was born in <em>Lancaster, Pennsylvania,</em> where I grew up and live today.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph">
            At a young age I gained an interest in computers through playing video games and solving IT problems for my family. I first dabbled into programming on my TI-84 graphing calculator in highschool. <b>I really enjoyed the logic behind it.</b>
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph">
            After graduating high school in 2017, I decided to major in Computer Science at <em>Messiah University.</em> While there, I loved my programming classes, especially a web development class where we built a full-stack app from scratch. <b>I soon decided I would pursue a career in software engineering.</b>
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph">
            To that end, I began working as an Application Developer Intern for <em>Listrak</em>. I had an amazing time there and learned a ton about the software industry. The following summer, I began working as a Backend Developer Intern for <em>HomeX.</em> The experience really expanded my horizons and increased my <b>passion for software engineering.</b>
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph">
            In May of 2021, I completed my final semester at Messiah University. I delivered my capstone project: Hoodat, a mobile app for remembering names, and I achieved my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. After graduation I returned to HomeX to work as a full-time software engineer.

            Currently, I'm working as a software engineer for <a href="https://homex.com/">HomeX</a> in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
